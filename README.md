## Problem Statement

Token prices in the current market typically fluctuate based only on supply and demand. Engagement metrics from platforms like YouTube are not integrated into token pricing, presenting an opportunity to create a token system that reflects both market dynamics and content engagement.

## Idea

Our project, EngageCoin, aims to create an ERC-20 token on Etherium for each YouTube channel, with a price that dynamically adjusts based on demand, supply, and YouTube engagement metrics (likes, comments, views). This approach benefits both content creators, who earn royalties from trading fees, and traders, who profit by investing in tokens associated with high-engagement channels.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Etherium (Sepolia)
- **Smart Contracts**: ERC-20 Token with custom functions for price adjustment and royalty distribution.
- **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: Uniswap on Etherium.
- **Oracle**: Custom Oracle to fetch engagement metrics from YouTube.
- **Frontend**: Web application using `web3.js` or `ethers.js` for interaction with smart contracts.
- **APIs**: YouTube Data API to fetch engagement metrics.
- **Storage**: Filecoin for decentralized storage of engagement data and other relevant information.


## Conclusion

EngageCoin is a dynamic token system on Etherium that incorporates both market demand, supply, and YouTube engagement metrics. It provides new opportunities for creators and traders alike. Our next steps include deploying on the mainnet, refining engagement integration, and exploring further features.
